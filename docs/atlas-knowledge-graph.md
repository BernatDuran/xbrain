# Atlas Knowledge Graph

Atlas Knowledge Graph is the topic-first exploration surface inside the Atlas
workspace. It is generated from `items.json` enrichment data through
`compute_dashboard_data()` and remains a derived view: Markdown notes, topic
pages, and the dashboard never become a second source of truth.

## Data Contract

The dashboard payload includes `graph`:

- `topics`: topic nodes with counts, related topic count, recent activity,
  confidence buckets, content type buckets, overview, and optional topic note.
- `items`: compact document nodes with title label, 180-character summary, date,
  primary topic, all topics, content type, confidence, author, domain, note path,
  original URL, review signal, and suggested topics.
- `topic_edges`: co-occurrence edges calculated from item topics.
- `membership_edges`: topic-to-item edges, marked `primary` or `secondary`.
- `emerging_topics`: suggested topics that have not been promoted to vocabulary.
- `facets`: content, confidence, and month buckets.
- `insights`: simple explainable signals such as most connected, isolated,
  needs review, recently active, and fastest growing.
- `version`: deterministic hash used to invalidate incompatible local layouts.

## Atlas Views

Atlas exposes three internal views:

- `Map`: ECharts graph surface with topic nodes shown first. Documents appear
  only after search, explicit document toggle, or topic expansion.
- `Timeline`: time scatter plot grouped by primary topic, sharing the same
  search, date, content type, and confidence filters.
- `List`: accessible fallback for keyboard, mobile, and dense-corpus scanning.

## Controls

- Search covers topic labels and slugs, item labels, summaries, authors,
  domains, item ids, and topic lists.
- Date presets are `All time`, `12 months`, `6 months`, `90 days`, `30 days`,
  and `Custom`.
- Content filters are `All`, `Articles`, `Videos`, `Failed`, and `Posts`.
- Confidence filters are `All`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Unknown`,
  `Needs review`, and `Misc`.
- `Documents` toggles document nodes globally.
- Double-clicking a topic expands or collapses its documents.
- Double-clicking a document opens its note via `/notes?path=...` when served
  and `obsidian://open?path=...` when opened locally.
- `Emerging` toggles suggested topic nodes.
- `Pause` switches the map between force and fixed layout modes.
- `Reset layout` clears local graph preferences.

## Local Layout Persistence

Visual layout state is stored in browser `localStorage` under:

```text
xbrain.graph.layout.v1
```

The stored payload is scoped by `graph.version` and can include:

- pinned node positions,
- zoom and center,
- date/content/confidence filters,
- document and emerging topic toggles,
- the focused topic and hop depth,
- locally hidden topics.

This does not modify `items.json`, generated Markdown, topic pages, or the
Obsidian vault. `Reset layout` clears hidden topics and focus state. A new graph
version invalidates stale layout state.

Topic drawers expose graph-only controls for local exploration:

- `Show documents` expands representative notes around the topic.
- `Focus graph` narrows the map to one or two topic-relation hops.
- `Hide topic` removes the topic locally until reset or a new graph version.
- `Pin` stores the current node position locally.

The search box filters as the user types. Pressing Enter selects the first
matching topic or document, applies a focused graph context, and opens the
matching drawer.

## Served Actions

When the dashboard is served with `xbrain serve-dashboard`, document drawers can
reuse the existing local endpoints:

- `POST /api/topic-action` for accept, reject, regenerate, prioritize, and
  promote suggested topics before regeneration.
- `POST /api/reprocess-note` for single-note reprocessing.
- `GET /api/status` to wait for the background operation and reload the
  regenerated dashboard.

When the dashboard is opened as a local HTML file, these write controls are
disabled and the drawer states that topic editing requires the served dashboard.

## Obsidian Canvas Export

`xbrain generate` also writes:

```text
maps/xbrain-map.generated.canvas
```

This file is derived from the same `graph` payload as the dashboard. It includes
topic nodes, topic co-occurrence edges, and a small set of representative item
note nodes per topic. Topic nodes link to `topics/<slug>.md` when that topic
page exists; otherwise they are emitted as text nodes.

For manual Canvas editing, duplicate the generated file in Obsidian as:

```text
maps/xbrain-map.canvas
```

XBrain never writes that editable copy. Regeneration updates only the
`.generated.canvas` file.

## Validation

Before merging graph changes, run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_dashboard.py
uv run pytest
```

For visual checks, generate a dashboard and verify:

- `#atlas` renders a nonblank `#c-graph` canvas on desktop and mobile.
- `Map`, `Timeline`, and `List` switch without page errors.
- Date filters update all three views.
- Document drawers open notes locally and when served.
- Served topic/reprocess actions start jobs and reload after completion.
- `maps/xbrain-map.generated.canvas` is regenerated while
  `maps/xbrain-map.canvas` remains untouched.
